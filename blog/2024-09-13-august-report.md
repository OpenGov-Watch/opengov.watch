This month, we were happy to see many things come together that have been many months in the making. Our highlight was to give a Web3 Summit Talk titled [“Do we need Network Constitutions?”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN-4FEnjXTI), which sparked many discussions around the topic. 

The bring Polkadot a bit closer to it, we upgraded our Notion to become a complete [OpenGov Portal](https://opengovwatch.notion.site/). The idea is to give people actively participating in OpenGov a portal where they can find relevant links and points of contact. It is accompanied by a list of ecosystem issues and a summary of existing Polkadot Legislation.

From here on out, we will start to implement the theory laid out in past months in [BASED Budgeting](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/based-budgeting-a-bottom-up-approach-for-strategic-effective-decentralized-budgeting/9555). Our approach is to push [legislation through WFCs](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/legislation-through-wfcs/9982), and we start by testing the waters with establishing [Bounty Standards through a WFC](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/wfc-draft-bounty-standards/9991). If this is successful, OpenGov can in the future delegate certain decisions away from the general tracks towards those bounties, reducing the noise and establishing more structure for on-chain executive bodies.
