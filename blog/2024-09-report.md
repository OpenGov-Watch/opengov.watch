Mid September through Mid October we focused on two initiatives:

- [The 2024-Q3 Treasury Report](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/2024-q3-polkadot-treasury-report/10450)
- Pushing for [bounty compliance standards](https://polkadot.subsquare.io/referenda/1254)

This Treasury report had the first shades of routine to it. While it is still a lot of manual work, we at least have one year of experience now in getting it done. To potentially decentralize the process in the future, we also created a [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HH_yt5AtsKI&list=PL2OYlwKGkfOkqHvhyUNAWHBfMt9gQv67e) of the most essential processes to allow others to replicate the process.

Budgeting is still a big topic, and we are finally making tangible progress in translating [theory](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/based-budgeting-a-bottom-up-approach-for-strategic-effective-decentralized-budgeting/9555) into [practice](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/legislation-through-wfcs/9982). As a first stepping stone, we brought the [Bounty Compliance Standards](https://polkadot.subsquare.io/referenda/1254) to an on-chain WFC vote. The idea is to create a foundational standard upon which we can build a budgeting process in the future. This month, we published the first draft called “[Budgeting via subDAOs](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/budgeting-via-subdaos-wfc-draft/10448/4)”. The idea here is to establish the actual process by which quarterly budgeting may be introduced as a process to the DAO. We think the process is still going to take time. It is dependent on the support of major stakeholders and our ability to follow along with the progress of subDAOs.

For the next few weeks, we plan to work on helping bounties coordinate better. We were very involved in reforming the marketing bounty and the Ambassador Program and will report on that next. We have also identified a need in the DAO to improve workforce recruitment, so HR is becoming a more relevant topic. In addition, BD and DevRel are the next big pieces missing in the decentralized organization puzzle.
