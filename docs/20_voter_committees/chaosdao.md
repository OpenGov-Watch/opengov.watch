## Description

Consisting of 300+ members, ChaosDAO is a decentralized, democratic on-chain voting bloc. Voting members are alerted for each referandum and can vote internally in a one-person, one-vote system. ChaosDAO only votes if a supermajority of 66% is achieved on the internal vote. If no majority is achieved on either side, ChaosDAO abstains from the vote. 

Members of ChaosDAO can recommend new members to the DAO and the new membership is decided after the voting within the internal DAO governance.
