## Description

William is the COO of Talisman and leads their Signet enterprise initiative. He has an MBA, an S.B. in Computer Science and is a graduate of the Polkadot Blockchain Academy (HK).

As a DV delegate, William believes that evaluating proposals is an art rather than a science, as well as a conversation more than just an evaluation. The DV delegation is a responsibility to be a voice that advocates for the network and requires understanding and evaluating stakeholder views, including, in some cases, giving a voice to those that may not feel comfortable making their voice heard.
