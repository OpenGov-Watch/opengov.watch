# Accountability

Accountability ensures that the community has the means to follow progress and hold proposers accountable.

## Motivation
Goals:
- provide voters
    - with the necessary information to make a proper decision
    - with sufficient information to judge the background of the proposer
    - with an avenue to communicate with the proposer
- ensure proposers
    - have thought their proposal through and can deliver what they propose
    - align their proposals along with OpenGov’s preference for open-source deliverables, transparency, reasonable market-conform pricing
    - state all costs, including expected follow-up costs for maintenance and future proposals
    - use funds responsibly, effectively, efficiently
    - to break up big projects into smaller milestones
- allow auditors
    - to work efficiently
    - to report budgetary spending as per the [Spending Reporting Standards](/reports/spending_reporting_standards)

## Basic Accountability Checklist

For "Spender" proposals (proposals above 10k DOT), we suggest to use the following accountability checklist when reviewing the proposal. 

- **Scope**
    - **Objective:** When is the project successful?
    - **Measurement:** How will success be measured?
    - **Benefit:** What is the (measurable) benefit for Polkadot?
    - **Deliverables:** Are deliverables clearly specified?
    - **Deadline:** By when is the final delivery of the project expected?
- **Reasonable**
    - **OpenGov responsibility**: Is OpenGov the right partner for this proposal? Or should it be delegated to W3F, the Cayman Foundation, or a parachain?
    - **Proposal type**: Is the proposal in the right type? Should it rather be a bounty or a singular proposal?
    - **Ticket size**: Is the ask amount proper or should a smaller milestone be proposed first?
    - **Proper scope**: Is the scope reasonable and believable? Is the problem well-understood? Is the solution well-defined?
- **Declarations**
    - **Details on the beneficiary**
        - **Legal name**
        - **Registered Company or Individual?**
            - **If company:** Registration number, address, insurance status
        - **Domicile**
        - **Contact details**
        - **On-Chain Identity**
    - **Point of contact:** (if different from above) Email, TG, Twitter (DMs open), Element, LinkedIn. For complex projects, this coordinating role should be filled by a person from within the ecosystem
    - **Project updates:**
        - Where, when, and how often will progress reports be posted? (we suggest monthly updates in the discussion of the referendum)
        - Where and when will the final report be posted? (we suggest in the discussion of the referendum)
        - How will the community be engaged in the case of problems that risk the timely delivery of the project?
    - **Transparency:** What level of transparency on spending will be provided? Where? (we suggest a dedicated Github folder)
    - **Costs**: Any expected costs outside of the scope of this proposal? Future proposals intended? Yearly recurring costs? Expected future maintenance costs?
    - **Volatility:** Intention to
        1. prefer an exact DOT amount
        2. prefer an exact USD amount;
            1. request USD via spend() extrinsic
            2. if payment is in DOT will refund overpayment or request one top-up in case of volatility
    - **Refunds:** How will excess funds be handled?
    - **Conflict of Interests?**
        - Declare any potential conflict of interests
        - Through for which other projects have you received or will likely receive funding, from Polkadot or other DAOs or similar funds, directly or indirectly. List them.
- **Risks**
- **Previous accomplishments:** If the proposer makes claims about previous accomplishments, proposer shall provide proof via links to official sources that can be independently verified (actual proof rather than claims)

## Bounty Checklist
- Curators
  - Doxxed?
  - On which other multisigs over 100k USD in value are they?
