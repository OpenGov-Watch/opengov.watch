# Proposals: Prepare and Submit

### 1. Create a draft for your proposal
- Check out the [Essentials Guide](https://www.opengov.watch/guides/proposals_essentials) before preparing your draft.
- Check out the [Tracks Guide](https://www.opengov.watch/guides/proposals_tracks) to decide which treasury track is fitting for your proposal.
- Clear, open and transparent proposals will increase your chance to win community approval.
- Proposals are based on trust that promised work will be delivered on time and budget. If you are new, consider starting with the smaller proposals to prove your ability to deliver on time and budget
- The first proposal or initial milestone should be as small as possible.

You can modify the [generic treasury proposal template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O_84mXYFERCavmnJyxbIPKFkG0bVBySRjCVy-d-VKcc/edit) to prepare your proposal. However, keep in mind that a long and extremely detailed proposal might not be for your best advantage especially when the scope of your idea is not very wide.

### 2. Set your on-chain identity
- Setting up an on-chain identity is a crucial step before submitting a proposal. Proposal submissions without an on-chain identity have a high chance of getting rejected.
- You can use [multiple ways](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-identity) to set your on-chain identity. One of the easiest way for non-technical users is to use the service provided by [Polkassembly](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/opengov). After you connect your wallet, you can start setting your on-chain identity on the Polkassembly UI by following [this guide](https://docs.polkassembly.io/polkassembly-101/polkassembly-setup/verify-your-identity).
- Suggestion: A doxxed IRL identity will be beneficial for you to gain community trust, it is very hard to get a proposal approved if you or your team is anonymous.

### 3. Start a pre-proposal discussion
- We strongly suggest starting a discussion on [Polkassembly](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/discussions) or [Subsquare](https://polkadot.subsquare.io/discussions) before submitting a proposal to collect community feedback and adjust your proposal draft.
- Make sure you include an accessible URL to your proposal document.

### 4. Run a campaign for your proposal
- Be ready to answer questions on the forums, governance platforms and social media channels. 
- Appreciate all posts on discussion topics. Receiving a critical review is a good thing. Appreciate the time people spend on your topic and keep an open mind.
- Review the proposal. Read the comments and see what suggestions may improve your proposal. At this stage your proposal is a live document, keep it updated and inform about changes. Include important questions and answers at the end of the proposal.
- Try not to leave any open questions before submitting the proposal.
- Suggestion: Taking part and presenting your proposal on the weekly AAG show of [the Kusamarian Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@TheKusamarian) will help your proposal to get noticed and discussed within the community. You can subscribe to the Kusamarian calendar and find the links from [iCAL](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/5bc9ebf4456fdf8f953e8906acb210a1a37740301e05d7e78854101f8988d905%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics) as well as by following [the Kusamarian Twitter](https://twitter.com/TheKusamarian) page.

### 5. Submit proposal on-chain
- Again, there are [multiple ways](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-guides-polkadot-opengov#create-a-referenda-proposal) to submit your proposal on chain. The easiest way would be using [Polkassembly UI](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/opengov) for non-technical users.
- You will need to place a decision deposit in order for your proposal to be enacted. You can see the related decision deposits from [Tracks Guide](https://www.opengov.watch/guides/proposals_tracks). Proposals without decision deposits will be failed on OpenGov.
- Stay engaged with the community. Try to answer all the questions and address all the concerns in the proposal topic.
- Suggestion: Publish your proposal as permanent PDF document that cant be changed. You can use [Crust Files](https://crustfiles.io/) to keep your documents on IPFS.

### Retroactive Proposals
It is advisable to retroactively seek funding for the work you have already delivered. Since Polkadot is a permisionless network, you can build a minimum viable product or deliver the entire job you have in mind beforehand, than go to the treasury and seek for retroactive proposal. While the downside of this approach can be a failed proposal which can cost you time and labor, it is also a great way to establish trust. If you really think the work you submit is highly valuable to the network, you might pursue this path instead of asking for an up-front payment which is harder to get in many occasions.

### 6. Keep the community updated
- Stay committed and post regular reports on your progress.
Be honest and transparent. Inform the community about potential delays or problems that you encountered.

### 7. Deliver the project
- Show deliverables, results or any other relevant success metrics periodically.
- Create the final report and and link it on existing proposal pages.
- Stay engaged with the community. Try to answer all the questions and address all the concerns before finishing the project.
- Close discussion and enjoy the success. Grow your reputation. Use it as a reference on your future proposal.
