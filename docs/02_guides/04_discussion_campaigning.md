# Discussion & Campaigning

This page explains the discussion phase for you. All of the steps described here are optional, but significantly increase your chances to get a proposal approved.

Discussion and Campaigning are separate but intertwined activities. The primary purpose of discussion is to help make the proposal better (in scope or execution) and for OpenGov to deliberate if it should accept it. The purpose of campaigning is to ensure that the proposal finds acceptance among the voters. 

## Start a pre-proposal discussion
- Start a discussion on [Polkassembly](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/discussions) or [Subsquare](https://polkadot.subsquare.io/discussions) to collect community feedback and adjust your proposal draft.
- It can be incredibly helpful to already have a first draft of your proposal, but it is not strictly neccessary. You might just be having a good idea and are looking for reasonable feedback. If you have a written draft, make sure to make it available here for discussion. 
  - Make sure you include an accessible URL to your proposal document. (For Google Docs documents, make sure they are publicly shared for viewing/comments)
- Write a one-page summary of your idea or proposal. Make sure that it makes sense to someone who never heard about the idea before.
- Ask for the specific feedback you would like to have (fundamental/detailed, critical)


## Reacting to feedback
- Review the proposal. Read the comments and see what suggestions may improve your proposal. At this stage your proposal is a live document, keep it updated and inform about changes. Include important questions and answers at the end of the proposal.
- Appreciate all posts on discussion topics. Receiving a critical review is a good thing: It helps you understand concerns, highlights where your communication might have gone wrong, and helps you correct course. Appreciate the time people spend on your topic and keep an open mind.

## Campaigning for your proposal
- Regularly check for new questions on the forums, governance platforms and social media channels and engage them with a constructive attitude.
- Suggestion: Taking part and presenting your proposal on the weekly AAG show of [the Kusamarian Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@TheKusamarian) will help your proposal to get noticed and discussed within the community. You can subscribe to the Kusamarian calendar and find the links from [iCAL](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/5bc9ebf4456fdf8f953e8906acb210a1a37740301e05d7e78854101f8988d905%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics) as well as by following [the Kusamarian Twitter](https://twitter.com/TheKusamarian) page.
