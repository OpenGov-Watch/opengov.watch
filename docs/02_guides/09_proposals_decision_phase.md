# Decision Phase

## Submit proposal on-chain
- There are [multiple ways](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-guides-polkadot-opengov#create-a-referenda-proposal) to submit your proposal on chain. The easiest way would be using [Polkassembly UI](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/opengov) for non-technical users.
- You will need to place a decision deposit in order for your proposal to be enacted. The size of the decision deposit is dependent on the track. Check the [tracks](#proposal-tracks) chapter on this page for details. Proposals without decision deposits will time out on OpenGov.
- Continue staying engaged in [discussions and campaigning](/guides/discussion_campaining) during the whole decision phase.
- Suggestion: Publish your proposal as permanent PDF document that cant be changed. You can use [Crust Files](https://crustfiles.io/) to keep your documents on IPFS.

## Before Submission
- Do a last pass over your proposal and check if the introductory parts make sense for someone completely new to the project. 
- Make a last check on the discussion channels to make sure there are no open questions before submitting the proposal.

## Proposal Tracks

Network participants can request DOTs from the Polkadot Treasury via multiple treasury tracks that are logically split into tippers and spenders. You can learn more about tracks in the Polkadot Wiki: [Polkadot OpenGov Origins](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-polkadot-opengov-origins)

### Tippers

Tipper tracks have short timeframes for decision and confirmation periods, small deposits to be put by the proposers, and small spending limits. Tippers are a good start to getting familiar with the treasury, asking for retroactive funding for contributions to the Polkadot ecosystem, and building up a reputation in the network.

- **Small Tipper** can spend up to 250 DOT.
- **Big Tipper** can spend up to 1,000 DOT.

### Spenders

Spender tracks are for bigger asks, they can be utilized for various purposes such as recurrent services to the network, development of new features, big events, and long-term campaigns. Starting your OpenGov journey with a spender could be challenging as the network participants are more conservative and cautious with bigger asks.

- **Small Spender** can spend up to 10,000 DOT.
- **Medium Spender** can spend up to 100,000 DOT.
- **Big Spender** can spend up to 1,000,000 DOT.
- **Treasurer** can spend up to 10,000,000 DOT.

| Origin | Spending Limits | Decision Deposit | Decision Period | Confirm Period |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Small Tipper | 250 DOT | 1 DOT | 7 Days | 10 Minutes |
| Big Tipper | 1,000 DOT | 10 DOT | 7 Days | 1 Hour |
| Small Spender | 10,000 DOT | 100 DOT | 28 Days | 2 Days |
| Medium Spender | 100,000 DOT | 200 DOT | 28 Days | 4 Days |
| Big Spender | 1,000,000 DOT | 400 DOT | 28 Days | 7 Days |
| Treasurer | 10,000,000 DOT | 1000 DOT | 28 Days | 7 Days |

:::warning
Be advised: Network participants can issue **cancellers** and **killers** if they think your proposal is harming the network. Although the concept of 'harm' is more relevant for tracks that deal with the main codebase of the network, users might also consider treasury proposals harmful if, for example, the proposer spams the referendum.

- **Referendum Canceller** can cancel ongoing or upcoming referenda.
- **Referendum Killer** can cancel an ongoing referenda and also slash the deposits.
