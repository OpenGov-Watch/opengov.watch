# Monitoring

OpenGov advances at a pace that the regular observer can hardly follow. To make your life easier, we proudly present to you the **OpenGov Monitor**. It's a daily updated spreadsheet with the most relevant information on referanda, bounties, and more.

You can use it to keep eyes on everything or even start your own advanced data analytics. Enjoy!
