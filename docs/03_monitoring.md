# Monitoring

Look, we never promised that OpenGov is going to be fun. We only promised that is going to get nerdy. OpenGov advances at a pace that the regular observer can hardly follow. To give you a little bit of a chance, we proudly present to you the **OpenGov Monitor**. It's a daily updated spreadsheet with the most relevant information.

You can use it to keep eyes on everything or even start your own advanced data analytics. Enjoy!
